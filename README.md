# My Website — Starter

## How to run locally (Visual Studio Code)
1. Install Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. (Optional but recommended) install the **Live Server** extension by Ritwick Dey.
3. Open this project folder (`my-website`) in VS Code.
4. Right-click `index.html` -> "Open with Live Server" OR use the Live Server status / command. If you don't use Live Server, you can open `index.html` in a browser directly.
5. Edit the files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) and save — Live Server auto-refreshes.

## Notes
- The contact form is client-side only (demo). Hook to your backend or a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, etc.) to send real messages.
- Put images in `assets/` and update `index.html` paths as needed.
